  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU has been a transformative experience, both personally and professionally. This ePortfolio serves not only as a culmination of my academic work, but as a reflection of the core competencies and values I bring into the field of computer science. It is the product of rigorous coursework, hands-on development, and real-world application in my role as a municipal Asset Manager.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the program, I’ve had the opportunity to strengthen my abilities across multiple domains: <strong>software engineering, database architecture, algorithmic problem solving, system integration, and security</strong>. Developing this ePortfolio has pushed me to refine these skills further while also enhancing my ability to communicate technical work clearly to both peers and non-technical stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most valuable aspects of this experience has been learning to <strong>collaborate in team environments</strong>, especially when integrating peer feedback or supporting others during review sessions. Whether through code reviews or group discussions, I’ve learned the value of respectful critique and shared problem-solving — a skill that carries into my work on the <strong>Technology Review Committee and Innovation Team</strong> for the city, where cross-functional collaboration is essential.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Communicating with stakeholders</strong> has become a defining strength of mine. As someone who bridges technical implementation and civic operations, I frequently translate complex systems into actionable plans for department heads and city staff. This includes managing inventory workflows, developing digital forms with branching logic, and deploying automated processes using Microsoft Power Automate, Lists, and Forms. These tools have helped reduce errors, improve data visibility, and streamline compliance reporting across departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the area of <strong>data structures and algorithms</strong>, I’ve implemented real-time inventory prioritization using a <em>min-heap priority queue</em> — enhancing how restock urgency is calculated in my web application. This was paired with optimized filtering logic and dashboard display to ensure usability for frontline staff. These concepts were vital in transforming theoretical knowledge into practical decision-making tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Software engineering and database design</strong> are at the heart of my capstone artifact, which began as a mobile Android app and was re-engineered into a full-stack MEAN web application. I designed modular Angular components, secure RESTful API endpoints, and flexible MongoDB schemas using Mongoose — all while ensuring clarity, reusability, and clean code standards. Security was enhanced through JWT-based role authentication and schema-level data validation, demonstrating a growing mindset focused on protecting sensitive data and user access.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the artifacts showcased in this portfolio are technical in nature, they also represent how I apply computer science to solve meaningful, real-world challenges. My enhanced inventory app connects all areas of the curriculum:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Modular frontend/backend design using Angular, Node.js, and Express</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Priority queue logic for intelligent restocking recommendations</li>
    <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MongoDB schema enforcement, secure CRUD, and analytic pipelines</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Collectively, these artifacts demonstrate a full-stack solution that addresses both user experience and system integrity. They are framed by narrative reflections and a formal code review video to provide transparency into my problem-solving process and development growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ePortfolio is more than a project showcase — it is a professional introduction that reflects who I am: a strategic thinker, a builder of practical systems, and a lifelong learner committed to improving government infrastructure through modern technology. With my degree in hand and this work as my foundation, I am ready to contribute meaningfully to any organization seeking a data-driven and systems-minded computer science professional.

  <h2>From Mobile to MEAN: The Original Android Inventory App</h2>
  <p>
    This native Android inventory application was built using Java in Android Studio during my CS360 course. Its purpose was to help small business managers track inventory on the go. The app included secure user authentication, the ability to add/edit/delete items, and a notification system for low-stock alerts.
  </p>
  <p>
    I selected this artifact because it represents the starting point of my journey in building real-world applications. It was the first project where I implemented mobile UI design, user-focused workflows, and basic security. It highlights my understanding of the mobile development lifecycle, from activity and intent management to persistent local storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I reviewed the code, I identified opportunities for improvement in scalability, maintainability, and platform independence. These areas inspired the enhancement—transitioning to a full MEAN stack web application. Through this process, I demonstrated skills in code modularization, user experience design, and secure software practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project partially addressed course outcomes in software engineering and collaboration. Enhancing the app helped me better understand user-centered design, iterative improvement, and cross-platform architecture planning.

  <h2>Modernized Inventory Management: MEAN Stack Web Application</h2>
  <p>
    This artifact is an enhanced version of my original Android app, redesigned from the ground up as a modern full-stack web application using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. I created this artifact during my CS499 capstone to showcase my growth across all core areas: software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I selected this as the enhanced artifact because it exemplifies how I transformed a single-platform mobile app into a scalable, maintainable, secure system accessible from any device. The frontend was redesigned with Angular Material for responsive UI, while the backend leverages RESTful APIs and secure JWT-based authentication for role-based access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enhancements included integrating a min-heap priority queue algorithm to surface high-priority restock items and real-time inventory dashboards. I also introduced validation middleware in Node.js and Mongoose schema rules to improve data security and quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project helped me meet course outcomes related to software architecture, real-world algorithmic application, collaboration (through GitHub issue management), and secure development practices. I also recorded a code review video to explain the enhancements and design decisions to peers and reviewers.
