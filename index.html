  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU has been a transformative experience, both personally and professionally. This ePortfolio serves not only as a culmination of my academic work, but as a reflection of the core competencies and values I bring into the field of computer science. It is the product of rigorous coursework, hands-on development, and real-world application in my role as a municipal Asset Manager.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the program, I’ve had the opportunity to strengthen my abilities across multiple domains: <strong>software engineering, database architecture, algorithmic problem solving, system integration, and security</strong>. Developing this ePortfolio has pushed me to refine these skills further while also enhancing my ability to communicate technical work clearly to both peers and non-technical stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most valuable aspects of this experience has been learning to <strong>collaborate in team environments</strong>, especially when integrating peer feedback or supporting others during review sessions. Whether through code reviews or group discussions, I’ve learned the value of respectful critique and shared problem-solving — a skill that carries into my work on the <strong>Technology Review Committee and Innovation Team</strong> for the city, where cross-functional collaboration is essential.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Communicating with stakeholders</strong> has become a defining strength of mine. As someone who bridges technical implementation and civic operations, I frequently translate complex systems into actionable plans for department heads and city staff. This includes managing inventory workflows, developing digital forms with branching logic, and deploying automated processes using Microsoft Power Automate, Lists, and Forms. These tools have helped reduce errors, improve data visibility, and streamline compliance reporting across departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the area of <strong>data structures and algorithms</strong>, I’ve implemented real-time inventory prioritization using a <em>min-heap priority queue</em> — enhancing how restock urgency is calculated in my web application. This was paired with optimized filtering logic and dashboard display to ensure usability for frontline staff. These concepts were vital in transforming theoretical knowledge into practical decision-making tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Software engineering and database design</strong> are at the heart of my capstone artifact, which began as a mobile Android app and was re-engineered into a full-stack MEAN web application. I designed modular Angular components, secure RESTful API endpoints, and flexible MongoDB schemas using Mongoose — all while ensuring clarity, reusability, and clean code standards. Security was enhanced through JWT-based role authentication and schema-level data validation, demonstrating a growing mindset focused on protecting sensitive data and user access.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the artifacts showcased in this portfolio are technical in nature, they also represent how I apply computer science to solve meaningful, real-world challenges. My enhanced inventory app connects all areas of the curriculum:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Modular frontend/backend design using Angular, Node.js, and Express</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Priority queue logic for intelligent restocking recommendations</li>
    <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MongoDB schema enforcement, secure CRUD, and analytic pipelines</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Collectively, these artifacts demonstrate a full-stack solution that addresses both user experience and system integrity. They are framed by narrative reflections and a formal code review video to provide transparency into my problem-solving process and development growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ePortfolio is more than a project showcase — it is a professional introduction that reflects who I am: a strategic thinker, a builder of practical systems, and a lifelong learner committed to improving government infrastructure through modern technology. With my degree in hand and this work as my foundation, I am ready to contribute meaningfully to any organization seeking a data-driven and systems-minded computer science professional.

  <h2>From Mobile to MEAN: The Original Android Inventory App</h2>
  <p>
    This original artifact represents the foundation of my capstone project—a native Android inventory application built in Android Studio using Java. Designed to assist small businesses and warehouse managers, the app includes secure login functionality, item tracking, full CRUD operations, and low-stock alerts. It allowed users to easily manage inventory from a mobile device with a user-friendly interface and persistent data storage.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Android app served as the blueprint for my enhanced web-based MEAN stack application. By starting with a fully functional mobile solution, I was able to build upon real-world use cases and reimagine the same system with modern web architecture. The Android version highlights my early work in software design, secure coding, and user experience—all of which evolved as I transitioned to full-stack development using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.
  </p>

  <p>
    The original source code is available on GitHub and remains an important part of my development journey, showcasing how I move from platform-specific builds to scalable, cross-platform solutions.
